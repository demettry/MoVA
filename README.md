## Description
This is the code for the Museum of Virtual Arts (MoVA), a flexible virtual structure for the exhibition of virtual 
artworks. Key vision of this project is to create a "Building as Code" that can adapt in its layout and sizing (capacity) 
to the needs of its builder. I publish the building and its code as open source under the Apache License 2.0 
so feel free to copy and re-use! 

MoVA will be placed in Aetheria, Decentraland (coordinates will be published here). 

## Structural components
The building consists of modules being linked with each via bridges forming a module level. Levels can be stacked on top 
of each other to from a larger structure (got inspired by the "The Stacks" in Ready Player One). The modules are all of 
the same size which can be configured by the builder. 

In order to access the different levels of the building, an elevator has been implemented.
