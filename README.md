This is the code for the Museum of Virtual Arts (MoVA), a flexible virtual structure for the exhibition of virtual 
artworks. Key vision of this project is to create a "Building as Code" that can adapt in its layout and sizing (capacity) 
to the needs of its builder. I publish the building and its code as open source under the Apache License 2.0 
so feel free to copy and re-use!
